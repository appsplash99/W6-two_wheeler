# Zen-Mind
Zen-Mind is made to support everyone who experience anxiety due to academic, social, financial, and career pressure. The Web-App has information on mental wellness and resources, recommended activities that are COVID friendly, and interactive tools aimed at helping individuals get out of a bad cycle of anxiety. These include a to-do list that allows individuals to arrange their tasks and focus on a few important things, so they wonâ€™t be overwhelmed. This takes a proactive step towards facing issues of anxiety head-on, rather than procrastinating, which is known to cause further anxiety. Finally, the website includes a meditation tool with soothing music for those who just need a breather and to regain their presence.
